Hi mum,

Sit down.  Let's talk about the command line.

The command line on a computer allows you to make your computer do things without the need of a Visual User Interface.  If a visual interface allows you to create a file, you can do that with a text command instead.

Here's a few examples.

1. cd <folderName>
Changes your working directory to the folder you specify.

2. cd ..
Will navigate you up a level in your folder tree.

3. cd ../..
Will navigate you up 2 levels from your current folder.

4. touch <filename>
Creates a file with the name you specify.

5. mkdir <foldername>
Creates a directory with a name you specify.

6. pushd
Will add the current directory that you are in into a "special place" that you can then come back to quickly with the popd command

7. popd
Takes you to the last directory that you were in, or that you pushd up into the "special place"

8. pwd
Stands for print working directory.

9. ls
Lists all files and folders in the current directory.

10. exit
Lets you out of the command line.
